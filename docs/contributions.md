# How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to the Latent Diffusion Guidebook, please follow these steps:

**Fork the repository:** First, you will need to create a copy of the guidebook's repository on your own GitHub account. This is called "forking" the repository. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button at the top of the repository page.

**Clone the repository:** Next, you will need to download a copy of the repository to your local computer. This is called "cloning" the repository. You can do this by using the following command: git clone <https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/latent-diffusion-guidebook.git> (replace "YOUR-USERNAME" with your own GitHub username).

**Create a new branch:** When making changes to the guidebook, it is best to create a separate branch for your work. This allows you to experiment with different ideas without affecting the main branch of the repository. You can create a new branch by using the following command: git checkout -b my-changes (replace "my-changes" with a descriptive name for your branch).

**Make your changes:** Now, you can make the changes that you want to contribute to the guidebook. You can use any text editor or code editor to do this.

**Test your changes:** Before you submit your changes, it is important to make sure that they work correctly and do not cause any problems. You can test your changes by building the guidebook and previewing it locally.

**Commit your changes:** Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can save them to your local repository by "committing" them. You can do this by using the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My changes to the latent diffusion guidebook"
```

**Push your changes:** Finally, you can "push" your changes to your fork of the repository on GitHub. This will upload your changes to the cloud so that others can see them. You can do this by using the following command: git push origin my-changes (replace "my-changes" with the name of your branch).

**Discuss your changes:** After you have created a pull request, the maintainers of the guidebook will review your changes and may ask you questions or request additional changes. You can discuss your changes with the maintainers by commenting on the pull request.

**Merge your changes:** If the maintainers of the guidebook are satisfied with your changes, they will "merge" your pull request into the main branch of the repository. This will add your changes to the guidebook and make them available to everyone.

Thank you for considering contributing to the Latent Diffusion Guidebook! We appreciate your help and look forward to reviewing your contributions.
