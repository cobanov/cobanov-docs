# Domain

Private domain registration is an add-on service that many domain registrars offer and charge an extra annual fee for. Normally, when you buy a domain name, your information is listed publicly in the ICANN databases. When you buy a domain privately, the registrarâ€™s information is listed as the contact information. So, the domain name purchase is not anonymous, however it is private.

## How to Buy A Domain Anonymously

1. Use a private web browser like Tor Browser or Brave Browser
2. Use a shell corporation to register the domain name
3. Use a quality VPN service when buying
4. Tick "private registration" when registering the domain name
5. Pay with a prepaid credit card or cryptocurrency
6. Use an email address that is only used for this domain registrar
7. Buy from a domain registrar that accepts your payment method
8. Register the domain privately

## Be Careful These Steps

Some steps you can take to keep your identity secure include:

- Using Tor to register the domain name, but understand its limitations
- Purchase your domain name using a prepaid debit card (Visa or Mastercard)
- Tick "private registration" when registering the domain name, most registrars have this option and it will protect your details from being visible in the whois records. Keep in mind this needs to be done at the time of registration.
- If you register a domain and then make it private after the fact, your details could have been already archived. You can also use a service like Domains By Proxy (this is what some registrars use)
- Choose secure passwords (25 to 40 characters in length) for everything from your email, hosting and domain registration. This will be how a hacker would most likely get your information, by exploiting weak passwords in anything remotely linked to your site. I suggest a password manager like 1Password which allows you to generate secure passwords.
- Don't post any identifying information. Don't use usernames you've used elsewhere. Don't publicly disclose your location, name, age or where you work.
- Steer clear of social networks like Twitter or Facebook (don't create official accounts for your site on these sites).
- Choose secure usernames unique to your site, as mentioned above, don't use a username you have used elsewhere. NEVER use default users like in Wordpress, don't use "admin" for the username.
- Create a unique and independent email address, don't use commercial email services like Gmail, Yahoo! Mail or Hotmail as these are vulnerable and can be used to identify you. There are numerous secure email services out there that can help protect you.
- If you post images, make sure you have stripped any Exif data from them (date and time, location, GPS coordinates, filename, camera type).
- Disable any kind of social/beacon feature; no comments, no Facebook like buttons or boxes, no analytics code or anything else.
