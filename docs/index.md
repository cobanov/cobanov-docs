## About

Community lover, data scientist and generative artist. I love to share what I know, so I try to provide free data science and machine learning education to everyone on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/mertcobanov/) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@mertcobanov) channel. I teach at several schools and communities each year. I work as a data scientist at [Refik Anadol Studio](https://refikanadolstudio.com/), where we do great artistic works with my excellent team, and we try to digitize the **memories of humanity to immortalize it.**

## More

You can see my work in my [github](https://www.github.com/cobanov/) repos and my humble [portfolio](https://art.cobanov.dev).

I really enjoy writing minimal tools that make the lives of software developers easier, building end-to-end pipelines, and doing AI artistic painting works that motivate me immensely. I also digitize and repair old video tapes and bring them to high resolution and high fps forms.
